# State Vector Feature Semantics Registry

Status: Accepted semantics guardrail for Layer 1/2/3 state-vector fields.

This registry prevents the state-vector system from mixing direction, quality, risk, routing, diagnostics, and research-only payloads.

Canonical implementation:

src/models/state_vector_feature_registry.py
```

## Required semantic classes

- Direction fields are signed `[-1, 1]`: positive/negative indicate state direction only.
- Direction-strength fields are `[0, 1]`: high can describe either long or short evidence.
- Quality/tradability fields are `[0, 1]` high-is-good and direction-neutral unless explicitly named signed alignment.
- Risk/noise/exhaustion fields are `[0, 1]` high-is-bad.
- Liquidity fields must say whether high means pressure/bad or support/good.
- Routing fields (`eligibility`, `handoff`, `rank`, reason codes) are not ordinary model evidence.
- Diagnostics (`coverage`, `data_quality`, `state_quality`, evidence counts) govern trust/gating, not alpha.
- Research-only fields (`target_state_embedding`, `state_cluster_id`) must not replace inspectable blocks or be promoted without walk-forward fit/assign controls.

## Layer 2 correction

`2_sector_dispersion_crowding_score` is retired from the active primary contract because dispersion and crowding are not the same state. The active split is:

- `2_sector_internal_dispersion_score` — internal fragmentation/dispersion, high-is-bad for clean handoff context.
- `2_sector_crowding_risk_score` — one-factor/crowding/co-movement pressure, high-is-bad.

## Layer 3 tradability validation

`3_tradability_score_<window>` must be validated against path and execution outcomes, not only forward return:

- MFE/MAE balance;
- path efficiency;
- first target-before-stop style path behavior when stop/target policies are reviewed;
- direction flip count;
- state-transition rate;
- spread/liquidity degradation.

Stable short states can score highly when direction strength, trend quality, path stability, context support, liquidity, persistence, and quality are strong while noise, transition risk, and exhaustion risk are low.
