# model_01_market_regime

Continuous MarketRegimeModel V1 state-vector builder.

Boundary:

- Input: rows from `trading_derived.derived_01_market_regime`.
- Output: rows for `trading_model.model_01_market_regime`.
- Row key: `available_time`.
- No clustering, hard state labels, supervised regime labels, provider calls, or durable writes in the pure generator.

Runtime SQL reads/writes are isolated in `scripts/generate_model_01_market_regime.py`.

## Config

`config/factor_specs.toml` owns factor membership, signal directions, and reducer choices.

Supported group forms:

- explicit columns: `columns = ["hyg_lqd_30m", ...]`
- symbol/suffix expansion: `symbols = ["spy", "qqq"]` plus `suffixes = ["return_20d"]`

Supported reducers:

- `bounded_mean` → `tanh(mean(zscores) / 2)`
- `bounded_abs_mean` → `tanh(mean(abs(zscores)) / 2)`
